//27. Remove Element
// Given an integer array nums and an integer val,
// remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed.
// Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
// Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
// Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
// Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

//26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
// Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place
// such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
// Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,1,2]
// Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
// Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

//80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

//Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice.
//The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
// Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
// Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
